## The future is not neutral.

Every economic model, technological shift, and political decision creates winners and losers.

**Who Wins the Future** is an independent, community-driven publication focused on:
- power and inequality
- technology and its consequences
- institutions that shape everyday life
- ideas that challenge comfortable narratives

This is not optimism or pessimism.  
It is analysis.

> The question is not *what* the future looks like —  
> but **who it works for**.
