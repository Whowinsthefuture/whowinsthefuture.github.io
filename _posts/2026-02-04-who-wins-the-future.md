Every major shift in history has been framed as progress.

But progress for whom?

Technological change does not arrive in a vacuum. It is shaped by incentives, institutions, and power. The same innovation that creates efficiency can concentrate wealth, weaken labor, or hollow out democracy.

The future is not something that *happens to us*.  
It is something that is *decided* — often quietly, and by very few.

This publication exists to make those decisions visible.
